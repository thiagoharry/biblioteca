## Installing

Just configure your web server to run PHP and Sqlite3.

Then, copy the 'www' to a place where it can be served via web. Perhaps '/var/www'. Change the directory name to something more descriptive. Then, go to the project directory and run 'make reset_database'. Configure your web server and I think it's done.
